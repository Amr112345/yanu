## About

**Yanu** is a **Nintendo Switch** ROM updater made to be compatible with Skyline. The supported platforms currently consist of **Android w/Termux**, **Linux** and **Windows**.

The software is to act as sort-of a band-aid until Skyline supports Updates/DLCs natively.

> **Note**\
> **Doesn't support DLCs yet.**

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nozwock/yanu/releases).

### Supported File Types
- [x] NSP 
- [ ] XCI
- [ ] NSZ

> **Note** Support for others might be added.

## Installation

### Android w/Termux

## Usage (CLI only)
View CLI help with:
```sh
yanu --help
```

For updating a ROM:
```sh
yanu update --keyfile "/path/to/keyfile" --base "/path/to/base" --patch "/path/to/patch"
```

Set a new `Roms Directory` with (**Android only**):
```sh
yanu config --roms-dir "/new/path/here"
```

For unpacking ROMs:
```sh
yanu unpack --base "/path/to/base" --patch "/path/to/patch"
```

OR, for only unpacking a single ROM:
```sh
yanu unpack --base "/path/to/base"
```

For repacking unpacked ROM data:
```sh
yanu repack --controlnca "./base+update.bylies/patchdata/123456.nca" --romfsdir "./base+update.lielaws/romfs" --exefsdir "./base+update.bilies/exefs"
```

> **Note**
> - Control NCA is usually the largest NCA under 1MiB.
> - Yanu will only accept Control Type NCA, so you can atleast figure out the Type by trial & error incase it's too hard to guess.
