## About

**Yanu** is a **Nintendo Switch** rom patcher made to be compatible with Skyline. The supported platforms currently consist of **Linux**, **Android w/Termux** and **Windows**.

The software is to act as sort-of a band-aid until Skyline supports Updates/DLCs natively.

> **Note:** doesn't support DLCs yet.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nozwock/yanu/releases).
