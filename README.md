Yet Another NSP Updater for [Skyline](https://github.com/skyline-emu/skyline) [**WIP**]

Yanu, written in Rust is made to be compatible with Skyline. It **doesn't** support DLCs for now. The supported platforms currently consist of Linux, Android/Termux and Windows.

The software is to act as an band-aid until Skyline supports Updates/DLCs natively.

<!-- Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nozwock/yanu/releases). -->
